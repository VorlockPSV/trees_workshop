This is the project where you can train you algorithmic skills in:

- Pre-requirements and terms (example with minimum in arrays) 
    - Invariant 
    - Relaxation of answer
    - Optimal answer constructive
    - Dynamic programming 
    - Correctness
    - Marker that solution is not exists
    - Tail recursion over iteration 
    - Invariant inversion
    - Inclusion Exclusion principle
    - Partial sum/Prefix sum
    - Bit sets 
    - Performance testing
    
Array of integers in ascending order:
